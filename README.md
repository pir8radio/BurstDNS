Example links

https://pir8radio.github.io/SignumDNS/?bursthackaton2019

https://pir8radio.github.io/SignumDNS/?testing123

Clicking open on that page will open either the reddit hackaton page or http://hotwallet.cash in a new page/tab.

Adding `-open` at the end will try to auto open the link, if the browser allows it (due to popup blockers). for example: https://pir8radio.github.io/SignumDNS/?bursthackaton2019-open

To create your own link, buy an alias. And choose the URI option and enter your url. Then you can use it like the links above. `https://pir8radio.github.io/SignumDNS/?` and add your alias after the questionmark.
